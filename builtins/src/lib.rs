//! The JS language for rust-js (ADR 0102): what JS has that Rust's `std`
//! doesn't, as ReScript's standard library has it. Its promises, errors and
//! regular expressions, its byte buffers, its JSON, and its global functions,
//! its timers too, as ReScript's has them: every JS runtime has them. What the
//! browser adds is the webapi crate's; what `std` has, rust-js maps itself.
//!
//! It holds declarations only, so it's never compiled to JS: a program calls
//! what it declares, and the calls become plain JS.
