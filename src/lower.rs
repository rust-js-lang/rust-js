//! Lowering: rustc's THIR  ──►  our JS AST.
//!
//! The one idea to hold on to: Rust is *expression*-oriented (`if`, `match`,
//! `loop` and blocks all produce values), while JS separates statements from
//! expressions. So every THIR expression is lowered in one of two modes:
//!
//! - `expr()` wants a JS *expression*. Simple things (`a + f(b)`, `c ? x : y`)
//!   map directly; anything else is computed into a temporary first.
//! - `stmt()` emits JS *statements* and hands the value to a `Dest`ination:
//!   `return` it, assign it to a variable, or throw it away.
//!
//! Semantics follow Rust with `overflow-checks = off` (the release profile):
//! integer arithmetic wraps. Division by zero and `MIN / -1` still panic,
//! because Rust panics on those in every profile.
//!
//! This module owns dispatch, destinations and evaluation sequencing. `bodies`
//! owns function/nested-body lifecycle, `patterns` bindings and matches, `loops`
//! iteration, `places` reads and prepared writes, and `numbers` arithmetic.
//! `body_queries` has no emission context; its cached facts belong to `Body`.
