# 0078. `serde_json::from_str` is serde_json's reader, ported; `#[derive(Deserialize)]` is a table it reads by

Status: Accepted. Extends [0077](0077-serde-json.md).

Case: C, D ([0262](0262-when-rust-and-js-disagree.md)).

## Context

ADR 0077 made the client write what the server reads. The other way, the
client has to read what the server writes, and do it as serde_json does:
take what serde_json takes, turn down what it turns down, and say why in
its words, at its line and column. A client that shows "missing field
`orderId` at line 1 column 19" should show what the server's own tests
would.

`JSON.parse` doesn't: it takes a duplicate key, turns a `u64` into a
rounded float, and its errors are the engine's. And serde's derive writes a
visitor full of traits and generics that rust-js doesn't compile.

## Decision

**`$JsonReader` is serde_json's `Deserializer`, ported step for step,** with
its methods' names (`parseInteger`, `parseDecimal`, `endSeq`, `ignoreValue`
..). It reads the text's UTF-8 bytes, as serde_json does, so a mistake is
found at the same byte, and a column counts bytes, as serde_json's does:

- **Its messages are serde_json's**, and serde's: `invalid type: string
  "7", expected u32`, `unknown field`, `missing field`, `duplicate field`,
  `invalid length`, `trailing comma`, `recursion limit exceeded`, with
  serde_json's own words where it has them (`null`, not `unit value`; a
  float as it writes one).
- **Its places are serde_json's.** Where serde_json puts an error from a
  visitor where the reader is (`fix_position`), so does it, and it looks
  for a closing bracket after a failure, as serde_json does, since that
  moves where the reader is.
- **Its numbers are serde_json's:** an integer is exact to 64 bits (a
  BigInt past 2^53) for its messages, and a float is the significand times
  or over a power of ten, the way serde_json computes one without its
  `float_roundtrip` feature, which isn't always the nearest `f64`.

**A derived `deserialize` is a table of what serde's visitor knows**: each
field's name, how to read it, and what it is when it's missing. The reader
does the rest, as the visitor would:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct Order {
    pub order_id: u32,
    #[serde(default)]
    pub qty: u32,
    pub note: Option<String>,
    #[serde(skip)]
    pub cache: u32,
}
```

```js
function orderDeserialize_deserialize(json) {
  return json.struct(
    "struct Order",
    [
      ["orderId", $json.u32],
      ["qty", $json.u32, () => 0],
      ["note", $json.option($json.string)],
    ],
    ([order_id, qty, note]) => ({ order_id, qty, note, cache: 0 }),
  );
}
```

- **What reads a type** is `$json.u32`, `$json.vec($json.string)`,
  `$json.map($json.key.string, $json.f64)`, or the crate's own type's
  `deserialize`: what serde's impl for it reads, with its name for the type
  (`u32`, `a sequence`, `a tuple of size 2`).
- **A missing `Option` is `None`,** as serde's `missing_field` makes it: the
  field is read from a reader that has nothing but `null`.
- **The attributes read** are `rename` and `rename_all` (each side of
  `serialize = .., deserialize = ..`), `rename_all_fields`, `alias`,
  `default` and `default = "path"` on a field or the container, `skip` and
  `skip_deserializing`, `deny_unknown_fields`, `transparent`, `other` and
  `expecting`.
- **An enum is read externally tagged:** `"Dot"`, or `{"Circle": 1.5}`, by
  its variants' names, then as its variant holds: nothing, a value, a
  tuple or a struct. Its other representations are [ADR
  0079](0079-serde-tagged-enums.md).
- `serde_json::from_str` is `$fromJson(text, read)`: a `Result` of what
  `read` reads, if it's all the text holds.

**A derived codec is lowered only when it's used.** A shared crate derives
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` for its types; a client that never reads an
untagged enum shouldn't fail on its `deserialize`. So a derived
`serialize` or `deserialize` is lowered once something that's lowered calls
it, a round at a time, in the order they're declared.

## Why

- **It's serde_json's answer.** The `inbox` example reads structs, enums,
  maps, sets, tuples and arrays, with every attribute above, from right and
  wrong JSON (bad escapes, numbers, commas, keys, lengths, depths), and
  every value and error matches native Rust to the column. So do 2,000
  number texts read as an `f64` and an `i32`.
- **Ported, not rewritten:** each step can be checked against serde_json's
  own, by its name.
- **The table is short, and it's all the type's own:** the protocol, the
  same for every type, is written once.

## Alternatives

- **`JSON.parse`, then checking the value.** Short and fast, but it takes
  what serde_json doesn't, loses a big integer's digits, and can't say
  where a mistake is.
- **A visitor per type,** as serde's derive writes: the most literal, but
  each struct would be dozens of lines of the same loop.
- **Correctly rounded floats** (`Number(text)`): nearer, but not what the
  server reads from the same text.

## Consequences

- A `&str` is read as serde_json reads one, borrowed from the text: a
  string with an escape in it is `invalid type: .., expected a borrowed
  string`. A value kept for a tagged enum (ADR 0079) keeps whether it
  could be borrowed, as serde's `Content::Str` does.
- A `BinaryHeap`, `u64`, `i64` and `f32` can't be read yet; each is an
  error.
- `usize` is 32 bits, as on wasm32 (ADR 0025): `5000000000` is too big
  for it, as it would be there.
