# react: React for rust-js

Write React components in Rust. rust-js compiles them to the components
you'd write in JSX by hand ([ADR 0041](../docs/decisions/0041-react.md)).
The crate binds all of React's and React DOM's API, as of React 19.3, for
whichever React from 18.0 on your project has installed
([ADR 0043](../docs/decisions/0043-react-versions.md)):

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case)]

use react::{JSX, jsx, use_state};

pub fn App() -> JSX::Element {
    let (count, set_count) = use_state(0);
    jsx! {
        <button className="counter" onClick={move |_| set_count.update(|count| count + 1)}>
            {"Count is "}{count}
        </button>
    }
}
```

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button className="counter" onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1 | 0)}>Count is {count}</button>;
}
```

It's all bindings: rustc checks the types, and nothing of this crate ends up
in the JS.

`jsx!` is built into rust-js, in both the native and browser compilers, and
imported as any macro is, `use react::jsx;`.
Tags and attributes look like JSX; expressions inside braces are Rust.
Text is quoted (`{"Hello"}`), and handlers are Rust closures. See the
[syntax guide](../docs/jsx.md) for components, spreads and current limits.

**Use JSX to construct elements.** Element builders and `component(...)` are
compiler plumbing; direct use produces an error. Hooks, styles and React DOM
operations remain ordinary Rust APIs.

Attributes use React's spelling: `className`, `onPointerDownCapture`,
`aria-label`, and so on. Handlers receive typed events such as
`event::MouseEvent` and `event::KeyboardEvent`. A `ref` accepts a ref object or a
callback; `action` and `formAction` accept URLs, or on React 19+, functions
and action dispatches. No alternate prop names are needed.

A component is a function with a capitalized name that returns `Element`.
Its props, if it has any, are a struct, and a field named `children` holds
its children. A tuple of children is several of them, a `Vec` is a list
whose items need keys, and `None` renders nothing.

With `js::camel_case!();` in the crate root, props and custom hooks get
React's names: a field `on_press` is the prop `onPress`, and `pub fn use_clicks()`
is the hook `useClicks`, which React's rules and React Compiler find by that
name ([ADR 0046](../docs/decisions/0046-camel-case-crates.md)).

**Hooks** are React's, in snake case, with a `_with` variant for an optional
argument: `use_state`, `use_reducer`, `use_context`, `use_ref`,
`use_imperative_handle`, `use_effect`, `use_layout_effect`,
`use_insertion_effect`, `use_effect_event`, `use_memo`, `use_callback`,
`use_transition`, `use_deferred_value`, `use_id`, `use_sync_external_store`,
`use_debug_value`, `use_action_state`, `use_optimistic`, and React 19's
`use` as `use_`, since `use` is a Rust keyword.

- What a hook gives back is `&'static T`, read-only as React's state is, and
  `Copy`, so every handler can `move` it in.
- An effect's dependencies are a tuple: `(count, name)` is `[count, name]`,
  and `()` is `[]`.
- An effect's closure returns nothing, or the closure that cleans it up.

**Context and `memo`** are made once, as JS makes them at a module's top
level. In Rust that's a `thread_local!`, which rust-js compiles to just that:

```rust
thread_local! {
    static THEME: Context<&'static str> = create_context("light");
    static FAST_CARD: MemoExoticComponent<CardProps> = memo(Card);
}

pub fn Toolbar() -> JSX::Element {
    let theme = use_context(&THEME);
    jsx! { <FAST_CARD title={theme} /> }
}

pub fn App() -> JSX::Element {
    jsx! { <THEME value="dark"><Toolbar /></THEME> }
}
```

```jsx
const THEME = createContext("light");
const FAST_CARD = memo(Card);

export function Toolbar() {
  const theme = useContext(THEME);
  return <FAST_CARD title={theme} />;
}

export function App() {
  return <THEME value="dark">
    <Toolbar />
  </THEME>;
}
```

`memo_with(Card, |a, b| ..)` is `memo(Card, arePropsEqual)`.
Use `<THEME.Provider value="dark">...</THEME.Provider>` on React 18;
React 19 also supports `<THEME value="dark">...</THEME>`.

Put a context in a module of its own, `mod theme;`, as React advises. Saving
a file runs its module again, and a context made there is a new one, so
React remounts everything under its provider and its state is lost. That's
the same in hand-written React. rust-js leaves an unchanged `theme.js` alone
when `App.rs` changes, so Fast Refresh keeps the state. `memo` needs nothing
like this.

**React DOM** is `react::dom`: `create_portal`, `flush_sync`, the resource
hints (`preload`, `preinit`, ..), `use_form_status`, `request_form_reset`
and `browser`. Under it:
- `dom::client`: `create_root` and `hydrate_root`, with `RootOptions`;
- `dom::server`: `render_to_string`, `render_to_readable_stream`,
  `render_to_pipeable_stream`, `resume`, ..;
- `dom::prerender`: `react-dom/static`'s `prerender` and the rest.

Options are objects built by methods:
`create_root_with(el, RootOptions::new().identifier_prefix("app-"))` is
`createRoot(el, { identifierPrefix: "app-" })`.

Left out on purpose:
- class components and error boundaries, since rust-js has no classes;
- React's other legacy APIs (`createElement`, `cloneElement`, `Children`,
  `createRef`, `isValidElement`);
- anything `unstable_`.

## React versions

What a React release after 18.0 added is gated by it, `#[cfg(react = "19.2")]`,
and the crate is built for the React your project has. On React 18.2,
`use_effect_event` doesn't compile, and the error says why:

```text
error[E0432]: unresolved import `react::use_effect_event`
note: found an item that was configured out
496 | #[cfg(react = "19.2")]
    |       -------------- the item is gated behind the `19.2` feature
```

[`versions.json`](versions.json) records which release first has each export,
event and attribute, read from the releases themselves by
[`generate.ts`](generate.ts). The tests check every binding against it, for
every release. When React has a new release, `bun run generate:react` reads
it. Then the tests say which of its exports still need binding, and with
which gate.

## Build it

```bash
react/build.sh -o target/libreact.rmeta                         # the latest React; also writes libwebapi.rmeta and libjs.rmeta
react/build.sh -o target/react-18/libreact.rmeta --react 18.2.0 # for React 18.2
rust-js App.rs -- --extern react=target/libreact.rmeta -L target
```

`bun run build` does the first step. In a Vite project,
[@rust-js/vite-plugin](../vite-plugin/index.js) does both, on every save, for
the React the project has installed. See
[examples/vite-react](../examples/vite-react/README.md).
