# 0107. A const parameter is a value its caller gives

Status: Accepted: a function's, a type's and an impl's const parameters; a trait's and a
trait method's own by ADR 0135. Generic const expressions are to come.
Extends [0049](0049-traits-and-generics.md) and [0106](0106-generic-traits.md).

Case: A, D ([0262](0262-when-rust-and-js-disagree.md)).

## Context

`fn sum<const N: usize>(values: [u32; N])` has a number in its generics,
not a type. rustc's tests stop at them 75 times. Rust makes a copy of `sum`
for each `N`; rust-js makes one JS function, as it does of a type parameter,
and a type parameter's dictionary is already a value its caller gives.

## Decision

**A const parameter is a parameter of its own**, before the function's
dictionaries: `sum(values, N)`, `describe(values, N, TDebug)`.

- **Its caller gives its value**: rustc's, where it's known, `sum([1, 2, 3],
  3)`, or its own `N` in generic code, `count(N)`. A `bool` is `true`, a
  `char` a string, as a constant's are (ADR 0031).
- **`N` as a value is the parameter**, and `[x; N]` of one is `new
  Array(N).fill(x)`. A closure sees its function's.
- **A type's is its impl's methods'**, given where the type is known, from
  the receiver: `Ring.push(ring, x, 2)` of a `Ring<2>`.
- **An impl's dictionary is given them**, `ringShow(2)`: one for each value,
  cached by it in a `Map`, as its dictionaries are in a `WeakMap`, which a
  number can't key. `gridShow(2, 3)`'s cache is a `Map` of `Map`s.
- **Not yet: a trait's, `trait Foo<const N: usize>`, or a trait method's
  own**, `fn f<const N: usize>(&self)`, which its dictionary would be given
  too. In a default copied into an impl, a const argument may be the
  trait's or already the impl's, and its index can't tell which. An error.
  (Done by ADR 0135, whose copied default is given its trait's values
  alone, found where the impl's are known.)
- **Not yet: a generic const expression**, `{ N + 1 }`, rustc's incomplete
  `generic_const_exprs`, which rust-js would compute itself. An error.

## Why

- **A value is what a JS caller gives**: one function, which reads as
  written, where a copy for each `N`, `sum_3`, would read as nothing a
  person writes.
- **Before the dictionaries** is the order rustc declares them in, most
  often: `<T: Debug, const N: usize>` has its `N` in the signature's types,
  `[T; N]`, and its `Debug` only in the body.

## Consequences

- **Const generics are in** (`const_generics`): a function's, given on and
  with a dictionary after it, `[x; N]`, a type's through its methods, a
  `bool`'s and a `char`'s, a closure's, a function value's; an impl's
  dictionary for two values, a `dyn`, a std trait's impl, and one of two
  parameters; and the diagnostics test's refusals. Of the 75 rustc tests
  stopping at them, 23 pass, none giving another answer; 21 stop at a
  trait's or a trait method's own, and 13 at generic const expressions.
