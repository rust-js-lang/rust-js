# 0068. `VecDeque` and `BinaryHeap` are arrays; a heap moves its items as Rust's does

Status: Accepted. Extends [0036](0036-iterators-and-sorting.md), [0057](0057-ordering.md) and [0064](0064-numbers.md).

Case: C, D ([0262](0262-when-rust-and-js-disagree.md)).

## Context

Graph searches use a queue (`VecDeque`) and a priority queue (`BinaryHeap`,
often of `Reverse(..)` for a min-heap). Both were errors. So was a crate's
own `Index` impl, as a grid's `g[(r, c)]` is.

And `Reverse` wasn't an error, but was wrong: it was compared field by
field, like a struct whose `Ord` is derived, so `Reverse(1) < Reverse(2)`
was `true`, and `v.sort_by_key(|&x| Reverse(x))` sorted up, not down.

## Decision

**A `VecDeque` is a JS array**, as a `Vec` is (ADR 0036), with its own
methods:

| Rust | JS |
|---|---|
| `d.push_back(x)`, `d.pop_back()` | `d.push(x)`, `d.pop()` |
| `d.push_front(x)`, `d.pop_front()` | `d.unshift(x)`, `d.shift()` |
| `d.front()`, `d.back()` | `d[0]`, `d.at(-1)` |
| `d.remove(i)` | `$removeOpt(d, i)`: an `Option`, where `Vec`'s panics |
| `VecDeque::from(v)` | `v.slice()` |

**A `BinaryHeap` is a JS array in the order Rust's heap keeps it**, moved by
the same steps: `$heapPush` is Rust's `sift_up`, `$heapPop` its
`sift_down_to_bottom`, `$heapSorted` its `into_sorted_vec`, and `$heapFrom`
its `rebuild`. Each takes the items' `cmp` (ADR 0057):

```js
$heapPush(heap, [[0, src]], (a, b) => $cmp(b[0][0], a[0][0]) || $cmp(b[0][1], a[0][1]));
```

- **It's Rust's order, not just a heap's.** Which of two equal items comes
  out first, and what `{:?}`, `iter()` and `into_vec()` show, depend on how
  the items are moved. The same steps give the same answers.
- `peek()` is `heap[0]`, and `collect()` into a heap, like `from`, puts the
  items in heap order.
- **What Rust consumes is copied:** `into_sorted_vec`, `BinaryHeap::from`
  and `VecDeque::from` take a value that may be a clone never made (ADR
  0052), which changing in place would change for its original too.
- **A heap of items that could look like `None`** is an error, since `pop`
  is `undefined` for `None`.

**`Reverse` compares the other way round**, as its impl does:
`cmp(Reverse(a), Reverse(b))` is `cmp(b, a)`. `==`, `{:?}` and `clone` are
its field's, as derived.

**Another crate's struct is no longer compared field by field**, which is
right only for a derived `Ord`. It's an error, unless rust-js knows how it
orders (`Option`, `Result`, `Reverse`).

### Also here

- `impl Index<(usize, usize)> for Grid`: `g[(1, 2)]` calls the impl, as an
  operator does (ADR 0064). `IndexMut` is still an error.
- A constant index into a variable (`t[0]`) is read in place, like `t.x`,
  rather than put in a `const` first: comparators are one line.
- `[3, 4].slice()` is `[3, 4]`: an array just written needs no copy.

## Why

- **It's Rust's answer.** Differential tests push nine tasks whose `Ord`
  compares only their priorities, and check the heap's order after each
  push and pop, `into_sorted_vec`, `from` and `collect`.
- **It's the JS a person writes** for a queue, and a heap in a few small
  functions.

## Alternatives

- **Any binary heap**, or sorting on each `pop`: simpler, but equal items
  would come out in another order, and `{:?}` of a heap would differ.
- **A ring buffer for `VecDeque`**, for an O(1) `pop_front`. `shift` is
  O(n), but it's what JS code uses, and it keeps the deque an array that
  JS can read.

## Consequences

- A long queue drained with `pop_front` costs O(n²) in JS.
