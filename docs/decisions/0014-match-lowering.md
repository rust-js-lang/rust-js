# 0014. `match` becomes an `if` / `else if` chain

Status: Accepted

Case: N, C, D ([0262](0262-when-rust-and-js-disagree.md)).

## Context

`match` has no direct JS equivalent. JS `switch` compares with `===` only,
and has no guards or ranges.

## Decision

Lower `match` to an `if` / `else if` / `else` chain:

```rust
match n { 0 => 0, 1 => 1, _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
```
```js
if (n === 0) {
  return 0;
} else if (n === 1) {
  return 1;
} else {
  return fib_match(n - 1 >>> 0) + fib_match(n - 2 >>> 0) >>> 0;
}
```

The rules:

1. **Evaluate the scrutinee once.** If it's a variable, test it directly.
   Otherwise store it: `const match = <scrutinee>;`.
2. **Each arm's pattern becomes a boolean test** (`pattern_test`):

   | Pattern | Test |
   |---|---|
   | `_`, `x` | none (always matches) |
   | `0`, `true` | `s === 0`, `s === true` |
   | `Order::Ascending` | `s === "Ascending"` |
   | `A \| B` | `testA \|\| testB` |
   | `pat if cond` | `test && cond` |
3. **The last arm has no test**, if it has no guard. Rust already proved the
   match exhaustive, so if every earlier arm failed, the last one must
   match. It becomes a plain `else`. Arms after an always-matching arm are
   unreachable and are dropped.
4. **Bindings** (`x => ...`): if the subject can't change during the arm (an
   immutable variable, or our `const match`) and the binding isn't `mut`,
   `x` simply *reuses the subject's name*. Nothing is emitted. Otherwise it
   gets a real copy at the start of the arm: `const x = s;`.
5. The arm bodies get the match's own `dest` ([0008](0008-expression-and-statement-modes.md)),
   so each arm can `return` directly.

## Why `if` chains rather than `switch`

- **Uniform.** Guards, `|` patterns and (later) ranges are just boolean
  tests. A `switch` handles only the simplest case.
- **`break` keeps its meaning.** Inside a JS `switch`, `break` exits the
  *switch*. In Rust, `break` inside a match arm exits the enclosing *loop*.
  With `if` chains a Rust `break` is a JS `break`, with no labels needed.
- **It reads like the source**: one branch per arm, in the same order.

## Alternatives

- **`switch`** for integer/enum matches: marginally faster on huge matches,
  but see above.
- **Decision trees** (rustc's own match compilation): optimal, but the
  output no longer looks like the source.

## Consequences

- Not supported yet: patterns with fields, ranges (`1..=5`), `ref`
  bindings, bindings inside `|` patterns, and `x @ pat`. Each gives a
  clear compile error.
- A guard reads its arm's bindings from the places they name, as it's
  tested right after the pattern, before anything can change them; the
  body then binds its own copies, as any arm does:
  `if (shape.TAG === "Line" && shape._0 > 10) { const n = shape._0; .. }`.
  Generated programs found the rejection this replaces (ADR 0092).
- A guard that needs statements, a `match` or a block that writes, runs
  them after its arm's test, and one that fails goes on to the later arms:
  the chain is a labeled block, which an arm that matched leaves, unless
  its body leaves anyway, by `return` or `continue`:
  `arms: { if (s.TAG === "Rect") { tries++; if (s.w === s.h) { label = ..;
  break arms; } } if (..) .. }`. A guard in `matches!` still can't.
  Generated programs found the rejection this replaces (ADR 0092).
- An arm's test is evaluated only if every earlier arm failed, and a body
  runs only after its test passes. So a body mutating the scrutinee variable
  can't affect any test. That's why testing a mutable variable directly is
  safe. Only *aliasing* a binding to it isn't (rule 4).
- **A binding after `@` is its own value:** in `x @ B { b, .. }`, `x`, or
  where it's moved, is the same JS object as the value matched, so `b`
  isn't read in place, where a change through `x` would change it; it's a
  copy, if it's `Copy` and something changes it. `n @ 1..=9`, which binds
  nothing else, is as it was. Found by rustc's `bind-by-copy.rs`
  (`binding_after_at.rs`).
- **`Some(..)` is `Some`:** its `..` names no field, as `None` has none,
  and it was taken for `None`, so `if let Some(..) = x` ran when `x` was
  `None`. Which variant a pattern names is what's tested. Found by rustc's
  `nonzero-enum.rs` (`option_rest_pattern.rs`).
