# 0051. `Option<T>` in generic code: boxed only when it looks like `None`

Status: Accepted. Extends [0030](0030-option.md) and [0049](0049-traits-and-generics.md). Amended: concrete code boxes too; a lazy iterator's `find` boxes its own.

## Context

`Some(x)` is `x`, and `None` is `undefined` (ADR 0030). That's only right when
`x` can't be `undefined` or `null` itself, so `Option<()>` and
`Option<Option<T>>` are errors.

Generic code can't know. In `fn count<T>(xs: Vec<T>)`, `T` might be `()`,
whose value is `undefined`, or `Option<i32>`, one of whose values is. Then
`Some(x)` would be `undefined`, and would read as `None`. So every
`Option<T>` in generic code was an error, which ruled out ordinary Rust
like `fn first<T>(xs: &[T]) -> Option<&T>`.

`Option<&T>` was worse: the check didn't look through the reference, so it
compiled, and with `T = Option<i32>` a first element of `None` read as
`None`. Concrete code had the same hole: `Some(&())`.

## Decision

**In generic code, `Some` of a type parameter is `$some(x)`: `x` itself,
unless `x` looks like `None`, and then a box.** This is ReScript's approach
for nested options (`Caml_option.some`):

```js
function $some(x) {
  if (x == null) return { $someNone: 0 };                  // Some(None), Some(())
  if (typeof x === "object" && "$someNone" in x) return { $someNone: x.$someNone + 1 };
  return x;                                                // every other value
}
```

- **`None` is still `undefined`**, so "is it `Some`" is still `o != null`:
  a box is an object.
- **Taking the value out is `$someValue(o)`,** which unboxes one level. It
  appears in a `Some(v)` pattern, `?`, `unwrap`, `unwrap_or`
  (`$someValue(o ?? $some(d))`), `map`, and the closures of `map_or`,
  `and_then`, `filter`, `is_some_and` and the like. `unwrap_or_else` and
  `unwrap_or_default` are `o != null ? $someValue(o) : fallback`, as `??`
  would give the box.
- **It costs nothing for ordinary values.** `$some(5)` is `5`, so a generic
  function called with numbers, strings or structs returns plain values,
  and a JS caller sees what it would without generics. Only a `None`-like
  value is ever boxed.
- **Only where the payload could look like `None`**, looking through
  references, `Box` and `Rc`, which are the value itself (ADR 0023): a type
  parameter, `Option<T>`, `Option<&T>`, `Option<Box<T>>`; and in concrete
  code a `()`, a unit struct or an `Option`, `Option<Option<i32>>`. Every
  other `Option` keeps `Some(x)` as `x`. A literal that can't look like
  `None` is itself: `Some(Some(4))` is `4`, and `Some(None)` is
  `$some(undefined)`. (Amended: concrete code's were errors.)
- **Std functions that make an `Option` of a generic element box it too:**
  - `Vec::pop` is `$pop(v)`;
  - a slice's `first`, `last` and `get`, and an iterator's `find`, are
    `$someAt(v, i)`; a lazy iterator's `find` (ADR 0139), which has no
    index, is `$nextSome(items.filter(f))`, which stops at the first found,
    as `find` does. Iterator lowering, which chose the array or the lazy
    iterator, makes the whole result: `[None, Some(1)].into_iter().map(f)
    .find(..)` was `findIndex` of a JS iterator, which threw. (Amended.)
  - `bool::then` and `then_some` box their value, and `copied`, `cloned`,
    `as_ref`, `filter`, `or` and `or_else` keep the box they're given;
  - an iterator's `last` is `$someAt(items, items.length - 1)`;
  - `Result::ok` wraps its value in `$some`.

  Any other std call that would make one is a compile error, not JS that's
  quietly wrong.
- **A copy of an `Option` changed in place copies only what's inside every
  `Some`:** a box holds nothing that can change.

A box can reach a JS caller only for a value whose `Some` looks like
`None`: an exported function's `Option<Option<i32>>` gives `Some(None)` as
`{ $someNone: 0 }`.

## Why

- **Generic code is correct for every `T`.** Checked against native Rust
  with `T = ()` and `T = Option<i32>`, the cases where a plain `Some(x) = x`
  gets it wrong.
- **The output stays plain where it can.** `$some(x)` appears only in
  generic code, and it returns `x` unchanged for anything that isn't
  `None`-like, so interop is unchanged.
- **Proven prior art.** ReScript has represented nested options this way for
  years, and it's the same trade: an allocation only for the rare
  `Some(None)`.

## Alternatives

- **Reject `None`-like instantiations at the call site.** Keep `Some(x)` as
  `x`, and make `count::<()>(..)` an error wherever `T` ends up in an
  `Option`, however deep in generic calls. That needs the compiler to track
  every function's use of each parameter, and it would reject correct Rust.
- **Box every `Some` in generic code.** Simpler, but then a generic
  function returns boxes to its JS callers even for numbers.
- **Leave concrete code's an error.** It was, at first, since it changes
  the representation of concrete values. But it was 12 of rustc's tests,
  and the same helpers do it: `Option<Option<T>>` is ordinary Rust, a
  lookup that may find a `None`.

## Consequences

- An exported generic function called from JS with a `None`-like argument
  hands back a `{ $someNone }` box for `Some` of it.
- `$some`, `$someValue`, `$someAt` and `$pop` are runtime helpers, emitted
  only by modules that use them.
- A last `match` arm that does nothing (`None => {}`) no longer prints an
  empty `else {}`, which this change's example first showed.
