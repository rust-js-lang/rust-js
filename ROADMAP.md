# Roadmap: full-stack Rust with Scala.js-level maturity

**Rust in. Readable JavaScript out.**

Production readiness means a documented application scope that developers can
install, build, debug, deploy, and upgrade reliably, with evidence that the
compiler preserves its promised behavior and produces readable output.

**End goal: make full-stack Rust applications as dependable and practical as
Scala.js makes Scala applications targeting JavaScript.** That means broad
language and library coverage, correctness across feature combinations,
reusable shared crates, mature JavaScript interop, and reliable development
and release tooling. Readable JavaScript remains part of the promise.

The first production milestone is a React browser application with shared Rust
server types and JSON contracts. It proves an initial supported scope. The
long-term tracks below expand that scope toward the end goal; a successful
pilot alone does not establish Scala.js-level completeness.

Native Rust remains the server target. rust-js must make shared models,
validation, and portable business logic usable on the JavaScript side.
Platform-specific code needs explicit boundaries. Broad language support and
crate reuse are central work, even where an early release can defer them.

## Current position

Assessment: substantial compiler and application foundations are implemented;
production readiness has not yet been established.

Baseline reviewed: `4dca3fe`, 2026-10-03. “Implemented” below means code and
tests exist in this checkout, not that every combination is supported or that
the tests were rerun for this assessment. Each change is checked before it's
pushed, by the whole suite, the rustc suite and its mutations, in a Linux VM;
CI confirms on x86 from time to time. The latest successful
[Check run inspected](https://github.com/rust-js-lang/rust-js/actions/runs/36274665281)
tested `48caf69`, an earlier commit. Release 0.0.3 was qualified on macOS
arm64 from `9793b19` before it was published (M6.1).

| Foundation | Evidence already in the repository |
| --- | --- |
| rustc checks, lowering, diagnostics, and output preservation | [Compiler entry point](src/main.rs), [diagnostic tests](test/diagnostics.test.ts), [emission tests](test/emission.test.ts) |
| Collections, traits, generics, iterators, async, and common std operations within a defined subset | [Design decisions](docs/README.md), [native comparisons](test/compiler.test.ts), [trait tests](test/traits.test.ts) |
| Readable JS/JSX and source maps | [Snapshots](test/snapshots/), [JSX tests](test/jsx.test.ts), [emission tests](test/emission.test.ts) |
| React, DOM bindings, Vite, and Fast Refresh | [React guide](react/README.md), [Vite tests](test/vite.test.ts), [browser tests](test/browser.test.ts) |
| Serde-compatible JSON writing and reading for supported types | [Writing contract](docs/decisions/0077-serde-json.md), [reading contract](docs/decisions/0078-serde-json-reading.md), [differential tests](test/serde.test.ts) |
| Browser compiler and playground | [WASM build](wasm/README.md), [playground tests](test/playground.test.ts) |
| Automated checks and a compiler scaling benchmark | [Nightly workflow](.github/workflows/check.yml), [benchmark](bench/lowering.ts) |
| Cargo builds of shared crates | [Separate crates](docs/decisions/0100-separate-crates.md), [Cargo's workspace wrapper](docs/decisions/0101-cargo-workspace-wrapper.md), [crate tests](test/crates.test.ts), [the pilot](examples/pilot/README.md) |
| Releases on npm, and bindings as npm packages | [First npm release](docs/decisions/0120-first-npm-release.md), [`@rust-js/create`](create/README.md), [bindings on npm](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md), [create tests](test/create.test.ts), [patch tests](test/patch.test.ts) |

## Progress at a glance

| Workstream | Current assessment | Next meaningful proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language and std coverage | Substantial subset; important composition gaps | Current conformance inventory, then systematic closure of gaps (M1, M7) |
| Correctness | Differential, diagnostic, and snapshot suites exist | Required CI, generated cases, and feature-interaction coverage (M2, M7) |
| Full-stack code sharing | Cargo workspaces of shared crates build, with serde from crates.io; the pilot, an app installed from npm, shares its models with a native server | Registry crates compiled to JS (M8) |
| JavaScript and React interop | Working bindings, JSX, and Vite integration; bindings are npm packages, the first community one in its own repository | External application and library compatibility suite (M3, M9) |
| Distribution and upgrades | 0.0.3 on npm for macOS arm64; `bun create @rust-js@latest` makes an app that installs everything from npm; the pilot upgraded from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3 and back by [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md)'s steps | A clean machine, and a release that switches without `cargo clean` (M4) |
| Performance and tooling | Scaling benchmark and source maps exist; an app is a Cargo package a plain `cargo check` checks; JSX not expanded in editors | Measured application budgets and supported editor workflow (M5, M9) |
| Production evidence | Two releases qualified on their host and published; other gates remain open | Qualified release, followed by sustained independent adoption (M6, M10) |

## First production release: M1–M6

These are proposed completion criteria. All gates remain open; existing
foundations count toward them but do not establish release readiness alone.

| Gate | Complete when |
| --- | --- |
| M1 — Define the supported product | Compatibility and semantic contracts are explicit and testable. |
| M2 — Verify every change | Required checks test the candidate commit, including the browser compiler where applicable. |
| M3 — Prove a complete application | An independent React app shares models with a native Rust server and passes end-to-end tests. |
| M4 — Deliver an installable toolchain | A fresh project can install a versioned release without depending on this checkout's layout. |
| M5 — Establish operating limits | Performance, debugging, failure recovery, and supported environments have measured evidence. |
| M6 — Qualify a release | The actual release artifacts pass all agreed gates and a pilot upgrade. |

Start with **M1**, enable **M2** early, and use **M3** to identify the feature
work that matters. Packaging and performance work can proceed alongside the
pilot. **M6** completes the first production release; **M7–M10** describe the
remaining endgame. Work on those tracks can start earlier when needed by the
pilot. No delivery dates are assigned yet.

### M1 — Define the supported product

- [ ] **M1.1 — Publish a compatibility matrix.** Name supported host OSes,
  browsers, JavaScript targets, React/Vite versions, Rust toolchain, and
  dependency model. Distinguish supported, experimental, and rejected cases;
  connect supported claims to tests.
  Started: the [first npm release](docs/decisions/0120-first-npm-release.md)
  names one host, macOS on Apple silicon; the Rust release is the pinned
  stable 1.98.1 ([ADR 0109](docs/decisions/0109-stable-release.md));
  `@rust-js/react` supports React 18.0 on; the dependency model is
  [crates as npm packages](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md).
  A matrix in one place, with browsers and JS targets, remains.
- [x] **M1.2 — Consolidate the semantic contract.** Give users one current
  reference for numeric widths/overflow, text indexing, copying and mutation,
  eager async, panic/error behavior, and JS boundaries. Link to ADRs and tests;
  historical “not yet” notes must not masquerade as current limitations.
  Done: [How Rust behaves in rust-js](docs/semantics.md), each part of Rust's
  JS, its differences from native Rust in one list, and what's refused, each
  with its ADR, checked by running programs both ways. The decisions are
  their history: the docs index says so, and the README points at the page.
  Researching it found six wrong answers, each fixed with a test: `next()`
  of a returned `impl Iterator`, `{:e}`, an integer `-0` from `%`, a test
  returning `Err` passing, and two panic messages.
- [ ] **M1.3 — Classify the feature gaps below.** For each, choose implement
  before release, supported workaround, or explicit exclusion. The pilot must
  fit those choices without silently changing behavior.

### M2 — Verify every change

- [ ] **M2.1 — Make CI a merge gate.** Run required checks on pull requests
  and main updates, and require successful checks before merging. Include
  formatting, Clippy, Rust tests, differential tests, snapshots, browser tests,
  and the production example build. Today [Check](.github/workflows/check.yml)
  runs manually only; automatic and scheduled runs are deferred to avoid
  GitHub Actions costs during development.
  Branch-protection enforcement still needs repository configuration.
- [ ] **M2.2 — Require fresh native/browser parity.** Build or fetch WASM for
  the exact candidate sources and run parity plus playground behavior tests
  as a release gate. Missing artifacts must fail that gate. Today
  [playground tests](test/playground.test.ts) may skip without WASM locally;
  Check's WASM parity job builds candidate sources and sets
  `RUST_JS_REQUIRE_WASM=1`, making a missing artifact fatal. Qualification of
  the distributed release artifacts remains open.
- [ ] **M2.3 — Expand adversarial regression coverage.** Add reproducible
  generated/property-based cases for supported constructs, effect order,
  aliasing, Unicode, numeric boundaries, and malformed input. Retain minimized
  regressions. Require diagnostics and preserved output for rejected programs.
  The [conditional-regions regression](test/corpus/conditional_regions.rs)
  covers branch-local mutable-argument boxing/copy-back, guarded patterns,
  nested conditionals and repeated evaluation; its mutation restores the
  incorrect hoisting to verify the test detects it.
  Added evidence: [nested lowering regressions](test/semantics.rs) and their
  [native comparisons](test/semantics.test.ts) cover struct updates, effect
  order, and used inner results inside discarded calls. The [oracle](test/oracle.ts) compares panics by their
  whole message and values strictly, with [negative controls](test/oracle.test.ts)
  ([ADR 0088](docs/decisions/0088-corpus.md)). [Generated programs](test/generate.ts)
  of integer arithmetic, casts and control flow, each from a seed, are
  compared with native Rust and reduced when they differ
  ([ADR 0092](docs/decisions/0092-generated-programs.md)). Of 600 run on
  GitHub, one differed: an element assignment checked its index before its
  value ran, now fixed and kept as a [corpus case](test/corpus/assignment_order.rs).
  Programs now write and call functions with effects inside expressions:
  run against a compiler with the assignment-order fixes undone, 2 of 600
  differed and reduced to those bugs. Other kinds of program remain.
  Eleven known bugs, each put back into the compiler, are caught by the
  tests named for them ([ADR 0093](docs/decisions/0093-mutations.md)).

### M3 — Prove a complete application

- [ ] **M3.1 — Establish a supported shared-code build.** Build a separate
  client and native server from the same model source. Define how dependencies,
  features, macros, and compiler metadata are supplied. Demonstrate rebuilds
  after shared-model edits.
  Added evidence: the [shared-source build recipe](tooling/README.md#share-model-source-with-native-rust)
  and [independent-app test](test/shared-code.test.ts) compile common models and
  validation into native Rust and JavaScript, exchange JSON in both directions,
  reject malformed requests, and rebuild after a shared-source edit. The test
  uses subprocess transport. A Cargo workspace of shared crates builds with
  rust-js as Cargo's workspace wrapper ([ADR 0101](docs/decisions/0101-cargo-workspace-wrapper.md)),
  with the React bindings as Cargo dependencies, and Vite's plugin builds such
  a workspace, with Fast Refresh across its crates. The pilot (M3.3) is built
  that way. Registry crates compiled to JS remain open (M8.1).
- [x] **M3.2 — Integrate Serde into application tooling.** The
  [native adapter](tooling/build.js) and Vite accept `bindings: ["react", "serde"]`.
  They build locked Serde dependencies with the pinned toolchain and discover
  metadata through Cargo's structured output, without manual rustc flags.
  [Independent-app tests](test/manifest.test.ts) cover cache reuse, invalidation,
  paths with spaces, source edits and failure preservation;
  [Vite tests](test/vite.test.ts) cover combined React/Serde builds and refresh.
  General Cargo graph support and browser Serde provisioning remain separate.
- [x] **M3.3 — Deliver a representative pilot.** Exercise routing, forms,
  validation, lists, async loading/errors, cancellation or stale-response
  handling, and at least one external npm component through the supported
  interop path. Test real client/server JSON in both directions, including
  invalid inputs. Keep the app outside this repository's workspace layout.
  Evidence: [the pilot](examples/pilot/README.md), a contacts app of a shared
  `models` crate, a native server and a React client in one Cargo workspace,
  built by Vite's Cargo mode. [`test/pilot.test.ts`](test/pilot.test.ts) checks
  hash routing, a searched list whose older searches are aborted, loading and
  error states with a retry, a form validated as the server validates and
  showing the server's errors by field, Sonner's toasts, and the server's
  refusals of invalid JSON and contacts, in a browser with the server running.
  It's an app of its own, outside this repository's workspace, as one
  `bun create @rust-js` makes is: its `package.json` and `Cargo.toml` name
  rust-js's packages and crates by version, and an install from npm, its
  `postinstall` patching Cargo, builds its server and a production bundle.
  The test installs this checkout's packed crates the same way.
- [x] **M3.4 — Close the pilot's compatibility blockers.** Fix required gaps
  with native comparisons and readable-output snapshots. From the pilot: a
  binding as a value and a package's component as a JSX tag are fixed, and
  options objects (`RequestInit`, listener options) and the JS language's
  globals are the `webapi` and `js` crates' ([ADR 0102](docs/decisions/0102-js-and-webapi.md));
  `str::bytes()` iteration ([ADR 0126](docs/decisions/0126-byte-strings.md)) and `Result::as_ref`, worked around there, are fixed. Demonstrate error
  recovery, Fast Refresh, source-level debugging, and a deployed production
  bundle. Record any remaining limitations in the supported contract.
  Demonstrated by [the pilot's test](test/pilot.test.ts), in a browser: a save
  of its Rust is a Fast Refresh that keeps what's typed; a compile error is
  Vite's overlay while the app runs on, gone once fixed; the module the
  browser runs maps back to its `.rs`; and Vite's production build, served by
  the native server beside its API, works as the dev server's does. The
  pilot works around nothing now, so it leaves no limitation to record in
  the contract M1.2 consolidates.

### M4 — Deliver an installable toolchain

- [ ] **M4.1 — Package the compiler and bindings.** Define versioned artifacts,
  toolchain/sysroot requirements, checksums, and installation for each promised
  host. Verify installation and compilation on clean machines.
  Added evidence: `bun run pack:resources <output.tgz>` creates a versioned
  source-resource package; [package tests](test/packages.test.ts) compile React
  and Serde with unpacked host and resource tarballs outside the checkout.
  `bun run pack:compiler <compiler> <output.tgz>` also packages a native binary
  and launcher for the current host. The installed launcher discovers the pinned
  toolchain libraries and passes the package integration test. Clean-machine
  installation, platform qualification, and signing remain open.
  `bun run pack:distribution <compiler> <new-directory>` assembles all four
  packages with a compiler/host manifest and SHA-256 checksums. Tests verify
  checksums with `shasum`, detect corruption, preserve existing bundles, and
  remove staged output after a packaging failure.
  Distribution tests cover Node.js, including native launching and
  React/Serde preparation, with Bun out of reach; the JS and tooling target
  Node ([ADR 0095](docs/decisions/0095-node-runtime.md)).
  Released: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 and 0.0.3 of the compiler's packages are on npm for macOS
  arm64, built on that host with `bun run build:release` and qualified there
  ([ADR 0120](docs/decisions/0120-first-npm-release.md)). The binding crates
  are npm packages, `@rust-js/builtins`, `@rust-js/webapi` and
  `@rust-js/react`, which an app's Cargo finds through a patch its install
  writes ([ADR 0118](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md),
  [patch tests](test/patch.test.ts), [package tests](test/npm-crates.test.ts)).
  Clean-machine installation, other hosts, and signing remain open.
- [x] **M4.2 — Decouple Vite from the source checkout.** Ship the plugin and
  binding assets with explicit versions and configuration. The
  [private plugin](vite-plugin/package.json) now declares its versioned
  [build-host dependency](tooling/package.json); the
  [package test](test/packages.test.ts) verifies offline Bun installation and
  frozen-lockfile reuse of local tarballs, then compiles an independent app with
  automatically discovered compiler and resource packages from the app's
  dependencies. Explicit paths take precedence; checkout defaults are a
  development fallback.
  Done: an app `bun create @rust-js@latest` makes builds with only what it
  installs from npm. Its `Cargo.toml` names its crates by version, the Vite
  plugin builds it as a Cargo package, and a plain `cargo check` checks it
  ([create tests](test/create.test.ts), `739263e`). The 0.0.2 app, made and
  installed from npm, with `@rust-js-bindings/canvas-confetti` added, ran in a
  browser and built for production.
- [ ] **M4.3 — Provide a reproducible starter and upgrade path.** Document
  create/build/test/deploy commands, expose compiler/toolchain versions in
  diagnostics, define compatibility/versioning rules, and publish migration
  notes for breaking changes. Verify a previous-version app can upgrade and
  roll back using the documented steps.
  Added evidence: `--version-json` reports the manifest compiler identity;
  packaged-resource preparation rejects release/pin mismatches before building.
  [Package tests](test/packages.test.ts) verify rejection, preserved output, and
  recovery after restoring matching resources. A real release upgrade remains open.
  The starter's README documents create, dev and build. Versioning rules
  are written: every compiler package at the compiler's version (ADR 0120),
  and a binding at its library's major and minor
  ([ADR 0116](docs/decisions/0116-binding-versions.md)). Each release's notes,
  migration and rollback steps among them, are [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md)'s,
  from 0.0.3, and the pilot's README has its deploy commands. Upgraded and
  rolled back on macOS arm64 with the published packages: the pilot, outside
  this checkout, from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3 and back by the changelog's steps, built
  each time from no JS by the compiler npm installed, served by its server,
  and used in a browser. The rollback stopped at a crate the other compiler
  built, as Cargo couldn't tell the compilers apart: the changelog says to
  `cargo clean`, and the next release tells Cargo which rust-js it runs
  ([ADR 0101](docs/decisions/0101-cargo-workspace-wrapper.md)). Remaining:
  a release that switches without `cargo clean`, and the starter's test and
  deploy commands.

### M5 — Establish operating limits

- [ ] **M5.1 — Measure application-scale performance.** Set budgets before
  claiming readiness: cold build, edit-to-refresh, peak memory, generated JS
  size, helper overhead, and runtime hot paths. Record hardware, fixture sizes,
  versions, and repeatable measurements. The existing module-graph benchmark
  is a useful start, but it does not measure a production application.
- [ ] **M5.2 — Validate supported environments.** Run the agreed host/browser
  matrix in CI. Current [browser configuration](browser/playwright.config.ts)
  covers Chromium and Check runs on Ubuntu. Add Firefox/WebKit and other hosts
  if they are in the M1 support promise.
- [ ] **M5.3 — Make everyday debugging practical.** Document and test editor
  setup, format-on-save, compiler diagnostics, and source maps through the
  production bundler. [Stock rust-analyzer does not expand JSX](docs/jsx.md#current-boundaries);
  deliver the editor support required by the pilot and disclose remaining
  limits. Full JSX completion can be scoped separately.
  Added evidence: rust-js's syntax is stable Rust's
  ([ADR 0110](docs/decisions/0110-stable-syntax.md)), a plain rustc compiles
  a program ([ADR 0113](docs/decisions/0113-plain-rustc.md)), and an app is
  a Cargo package ([ADR 0114](docs/decisions/0114-app-cargo-toml.md)), so
  stock rust-analyzer checks it as `cargo check` does. Its crates from npm
  resolve through the patch; going to a definition in one isn't tested yet.
- [ ] **M5.4 — Exercise failure and upgrade recovery.** Test interrupted builds,
  unwritable output, stale metadata, dependency upgrades, and repeated edits.
  Preserve user files and previous output. Audit installed artifacts, runtime
  helpers, and dependencies; document how users report compiler/security bugs.

### M6 — Qualify a release

- [ ] **M6.1 — Test the release artifacts themselves.** Run the complete
  agreed suite and pilot against the exact packaged compiler, bindings,
  plugin, and WASM artifacts. Record commit, versions, results, known issues,
  and performance budgets. No unresolved wrong-code, data-loss, or critical
  security defects within the supported scope.
  Started: `scripts/qualify.ts` checks a distribution's checksums, installs
  it outside the checkout, and runs the whole suite through the installed
  launcher, and the package test with the packaged binary, writing a report
  of commit, host, runtimes and results; the [Qualify](.github/workflows/qualify.yml)
  workflow does it per host ([ADR 0094](docs/decisions/0094-qualification.md)).
  First qualified: the distribution of `4bd4366` for Linux x64, on GitHub's
  `ubuntu-latest`, with 605 tests through the installed launcher and the
  package test on the packaged binary, all passing; its four packages rebuilt
  byte for byte from the same source on another machine. Other hosts wait on
  correctness and completeness (M7–M10) before a release is made for them.
  Released: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 and 0.0.3 for macOS arm64, each qualified on that host
  before it was published. 0.0.3, from `9793b19`, passed 915 tests through the
  installed launcher, the package test on the packaged binary, and the Vite
  app's test, and each published package's files are the tarball tested's.
  Its first qualification failed on the pilot's tests, whose checkout hadn't
  installed a dependency, which they now say.
  The support matrix, the WASM compiler and performance budgets remain open.
- [ ] **M6.2 — Complete a pilot release and upgrade.** Deploy the pilot,
  observe it for an agreed period with agreed success criteria, fix blockers,
  and test an upgrade and rollback. Publish the support matrix, release notes,
  and remaining exclusions before calling the release production-ready.

## Toward Scala.js-level correctness and completeness: M7–M10

These tracks require sustained work beyond the first release. Their criteria
describe maturity to demonstrate, not a claim of equivalence today. Use Scala.js
as a reference for conformance discipline, library coverage, interop, and
tooling while preserving rust-js's own readable-output goals.

### M7 — Broad, composable Rust support

- [ ] **M7.1 — Maintain a language and std conformance inventory.** Enumerate
  Rust constructs and portable APIs, mark support and intentional semantic
  differences, and attach executable cases. Track feature combinations as well
  as isolated examples: generics with options, mutation through traits,
  nested patterns, iterators with effects, and async error paths.
  Started: the [corpus](test/corpus/) of `fn main()` programs, run natively
  and under Node, records support with `run-pass`/`run-fail`,
  rejections with `compile-fail`, and gaps with `ignore-rust-js`, which fails
  once a gap closes ([ADR 0088](docs/decisions/0088-corpus.md)). Its first
  cases found and fixed two miscompilations (nested element writes, repeated
  index effects in compound assignment). rustc's own `run-pass` UI tests run
  the same way (`bun run test:rustc`, [ADR 0089](docs/decisions/0089-rustc-tests.md)):
  1,920 of 2,206 in scope pass at the pinned stable release, 1.98.1, every
  other one is a clear rejection, none a crash or a wrong answer, and the
  [known failures](test/rustc-known-failures.txt) only shrink. A test of a
  feature stable Rust doesn't have is out of scope, as no program of
  rust-js's can use one (`7962214`). Programs written as a person would
  probe what the rustc suite doesn't: the first, an interpreter of arithmetic
  (the [`calculator`](test/corpus/calculator.rs) case), found `collect()`
  into a `Result` returning the array of `Result`s. The 286 rejections, by kind: values of
  a type rust-js doesn't support (91; raw pointers the most common),
  std calls (70; intrinsics the most),
  expressions (13), constants of a type (17), statics of a type (15),
  and user implementations of a std trait (4: `Hasher`, `Future` and
  `Wake`). A user `fmt::Write` is given each
  `write!`'s text whole, a listed difference ([ADR 0166](docs/decisions/0166-user-fmt-write.md)).
- [ ] **M7.2 — Close core representation gaps.** Design and implement the
  numeric, option, reference, slice, and resource-lifetime behavior needed for
  broad portable Rust. Include wider integers, `f32`, nested options, general
  supported mutation, and destructor/cleanup behavior. Establish explicit
  boundaries for raw memory and other native-only facilities. Readable output
  must not depend on accepting incorrect results.
  Progress: `i64`/`u64` are exact BigInts, with saturating float casts and
  integer `TryFrom` ([ADR 0086](docs/decisions/0086-64-bit-integers.md),
  [`wide` example](examples/wide.rs) compared with native Rust); an `f32`
  is a JS number, each result rounded with `Math.fround`, shown with its
  own shortest digits ([ADR 0122](docs/decisions/0122-f32.md)), its bits
  exact but for a NaN's ([ADR 0156](docs/decisions/0156-integer-bits-and-bytes.md));
  an `i128` or a `u128` is a BigInt wrapped to 128 bits ([ADR 0171](docs/decisions/0171-128-bit-integers.md)). An `Option` of what can look
  like `None`, `Option<Option<i32>>` or `Option<()>`, boxes such a `Some`
  in concrete code as in generic code ([ADR 0051](docs/decisions/0051-generic-options.md)).
  A `Mutex` or an `RwLock` is a `RefCell` on one thread, an `Arc` an
  `Rc`, and a guard of a number in a variable names the cell's `value`
  ([ADR 0144](docs/decisions/0144-locks.md)).
  A `&mut` to a number, a `String` or an
  `Option` in a variable names its place, and `for x in &mut v` of them is
  an index loop ([ADR 0099](docs/decisions/0099-mut-references.md)); a
  `&mut` kept elsewhere is a handle, and one to a temporary a `let` of its
  own; a generic `&mut T` kept or returned is a cell, and a `&mut dyn` of
  the crate's traits its pair. A generic iterator stepped through, kept or
  lent as a `&mut`, is a JS iterator that knows where it is
  ([ADR 0071](docs/decisions/0071-stepping-iterators.md)). A generic one to
  an object inside what a generic function takes or gives, and a `&mut dyn`
  of std's, remain.
  Destructors run where Rust runs them
  ([ADR 0098](docs/decisions/0098-destructors.md)): variables, parameters,
  moves, temporaries wherever rustc ends them, generic code, partial moves
  and struct updates, closures, loops and `dyn` values. An `Rc`, an
  `Arc` or a thread-local holding a value with a destructor, a closure
  holding part of one, a `dyn` of std's traits owning one, and some
  temporaries (a let-chain's, one partly moved) are rejected.
- [ ] **M7.3 — Complete reusable abstraction support.** Extend associated
  types/constants, generic traits and methods, const generics, trait objects,
  closures, macros, and async composition against the inventory. Test them
  across modules and crates; remove application-specific special cases where
  general support is required.
- [ ] **M7.4 — Expand portable library coverage systematically.** Cover the
  agreed collection, text/Unicode, numeric, iterator, error, and serialization
  APIs. Verify operation sequences and edge cases against native Rust. Resolve
  the current gaps below and record any deliberate platform exclusions.
- [ ] **M7.5 — Run continuous conformance testing.** Maintain deterministic
  generated tests, fuzzing with minimized regression cases, and cross-engine
  execution. Track failures by compiler version and feature family. A feature
  is complete only when its contract and interaction cases pass.

### M8 — Reusable full-stack Rust crates

- [ ] **M8.1 — Build Cargo dependency graphs.** Support separately maintained
  shared crates, transitive dependencies, features, `cfg`, and the agreed
  build-script/procedural-macro model. Specify metadata and artifact versioning,
  module linking, dependency invalidation, and reproducible builds.
  Initial evidence: `tooling/cargo.js` discovers an offline, locked local-library
  graph with dependency aliases, resolved features and dependency ordering;
  `test/cargo.test.ts` exercises independent workspaces. `test/cargo-link.test.ts`
  now separately compiles and links a scalar path library, compares native/JS
  execution, and rejects stale inputs, incompatible identities and signatures
  before publication. See [ADR 0085](docs/decisions/0085-scalar-library-linkage.md).
  [ADR 0100](docs/decisions/0100-separate-crates.md) grows that contract to the
  types, methods, impls and generic functions a library exports: rust-js writes
  each library's JS, its metadata and a manifest from one build, and a consumer
  checks the crate hash of what rustc loaded against it. `test/crates.test.ts`
  compiles a three-crate app, each crate on its own, and compares it with native.
  [ADR 0101](docs/decisions/0101-cargo-workspace-wrapper.md) builds a workspace
  with Cargo: rust-js is its `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, compiling each library
  of the workspace with Cargo's flags, and rustc builds serde, build scripts and
  procedural macros. The same crates as a workspace, with serde from crates.io,
  print what native `cargo run` does and follow an edit; each feature set is
  JS of its own, beside Cargo's metadata of it, and rust-js changed rebuilds
  them. An app's crates from npm are Cargo dependencies by version, which a
  patch its install writes finds in `node_modules`
  ([ADR 0118](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md)). Registry crates
  compiled to JS, and `cargo build`, remain open.
  First proof: a separate Cargo library with a non-generic scalar function,
  consumed through a path dependency by both a native executable and a rust-js
  application. Resolve the dependency from Cargo metadata, compile it separately,
  link its JS export through versioned dependency metadata, and compare results.
  A dependency edit must invalidate the consumer build; incompatible artifact
  identities must fail before publication. This narrow proof does not establish
  support for exported generics, trait evidence, build scripts or procedural macros.
- [ ] **M8.2 — Prove ecosystem compatibility.** Keep a versioned corpus of
  representative portable crates and real applications. Track each as builds
  unchanged, needs documented target adaptation, or blocked with a specific
  cause. Run the corpus on compiler and toolchain upgrades.
  Started: [the crate corpus](docs/crate-corpus.md), 16 crates shared models
  use, each compiled to JS with its whole graph by `bun scripts/crate-corpus.ts`.
  2 compile, strum and thiserror; the rest stop at a few gaps, raw memory the most
  common, in 9. Fixed since it was first
  measured: a generic trait method where a type may have a destructor, which
  stopped 9, a user `DoubleEndedIterator` or `ExactSizeIterator`, 8, a user
  `LowerHex` or `Pointer`, 2, a user `fmt::Write`, 3, a user `Borrow`, 3,
  a user `Hash`, 4, a user `AsMut` or `BorrowMut`, 2, same-named traits'
  impls named alike, slice methods, `size_hint()`, `?` of a value with a
  destructor, a `#![no_std]` crate's std items, 128-bit integers, UTF-8 decoding,
  paths as text, generic `{:x}` and `{:p}`, and two crashes.
- [ ] **M8.3 — Share behavior as well as data.** Demonstrate the same model,
  validation, serialization, and domain-logic crates on a native Rust server
  and a rust-js client, including dependencies. Require integration and
  differential tests to agree across the client/server boundary.
  First proof (ADR 0100): `validation` and `models` crates, with serde, used by
  a rust-js `frontend` compiled separately, print what the same crates do
  natively, before and after an edit to `validation`. A Cargo-driven build of
  the graph, and a server talking to the client, remain.

### M9 — Mature JavaScript ecosystem and developer experience

- [ ] **M9.1 — Stabilize interop for reusable libraries.** Specify and test
  import/export conventions, callbacks, ownership at JS boundaries, nullish
  values, exceptions, promises, and public generic representations. Prove
  consumption from JavaScript and TypeScript with a usable typing strategy.
- [ ] **M9.2 — Make daily development dependable.** Provide editor diagnostics,
  navigation, completion, and formatting for supported Rust/JSX workflows.
  Maintain binding-generation and dependency-version tests. Exercise React
  composition, external npm libraries, debugging, and refresh in real projects.
  Started: a binding is an npm package whose peer dependencies hold its
  library's range ([ADRs 0116](docs/decisions/0116-binding-versions.md) and
  [0118](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md)), and the community's
  are kept in `rust-js-lang/bindings`
  ([ADR 0119](docs/decisions/0119-community-bindings.md)). The first,
  `@rust-js-bindings/canvas-confetti`, is tested in a browser against the
  real library. The repository's CI and its bot remain.
- [ ] **M9.3 — Scale builds and output.** Measure large dependency graphs,
  incremental rebuilds, memory, dead-code removal through supported bundlers,
  helper duplication, and code splitting. Implement the improvements needed to
  meet published budgets while preserving semantics, readability, and maps.

### M10 — Demonstrate lasting production maturity

- [ ] **M10.1 — Establish independent production use.** Maintain multiple
  independently developed full-stack applications with different workloads.
  Record reliability, compiler blockers, upgrade cost, and performance over an
  agreed observation period. The compiler's own playground is one data point.
- [ ] **M10.2 — Sustain compatibility across releases.** Maintain a release
  policy, supported toolchain/dependency versions, regression triage, security
  response, and migration guides. Test old application sources and packages
  against new compiler releases according to that policy.
- [ ] **M10.3 — Reassess the end goal with evidence.** Review the conformance
  inventory, crate corpus, tooling coverage, unresolved defects, and production
  experience together. Keep missing ordinary application capabilities visible;
  do not declare completeness by narrowing the inventory after the fact.

## Confirmed feature gaps to prioritize

These are current boundaries checked against implementation or diagnostic
tests. M1.3 and the pilot identify first-release blockers; M7 and M8 track the
broader completeness work.

| Area | Current gap and evidence | Why it may matter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency reuse | A Cargo workspace builds with rust-js as its wrapper ([ADR 0101](docs/decisions/0101-cargo-workspace-wrapper.md)), each crate JS of its own ([ADR 0100](docs/decisions/0100-separate-crates.md)), and an app's binding crates come from npm ([ADR 0118](docs/decisions/0118-bindings-on-npm-only.md)); registry crates compiled to JS remain open (M8.1). | Sharing a model file is easier than consuming an existing shared crate and its dependencies. |
| JSON models | Generic derives, `flatten`, every enum representation, and `Value` are supported ([ADRs 0079–0083](docs/decisions/0083-serde-json-value.md)); `with`, `serialize_with`, `deserialize_with`, and some `Value` methods remain rejected (see [Serde diagnostics](test/diagnostics.test.ts)). | Unusual API shapes may still need new support or a documented schema choice. |
| Numbers | [Numeric representations](src/lower/representation.rs) support 8/16/32-bit integers, `f32` ([ADR 0122](docs/decisions/0122-f32.md)), `f64`, and `i64`/`u64` and `i128`/`u128` as BigInts ([ADR 0086](docs/decisions/0086-64-bit-integers.md), [ADR 0171](docs/decisions/0171-128-bit-integers.md)); `usize`/`isize` are 32-bit. rustc checks programs for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so constants, `size_of` and `cfg` agree with the 32-bit `usize` ([ADR 0090](docs/decisions/0090-wasm32-front-end.md)). A 128-bit integer in JSON is outside this set; a float's bits are exact but for a NaN's ([ADR 0156](docs/decisions/0156-integer-bits-and-bytes.md)). | External schemas and numeric code may use them. |
| Traits and generics | A trait's type parameters, associated types, generic methods and constants are supported ([ADR 0106](docs/decisions/0106-generic-traits.md)), const generics of functions, types and impls ([ADR 0107](docs/decisions/0107-const-generics.md)), and operators and `Into` in generic code ([ADR 0108](docs/decisions/0108-generic-operators-and-into.md)); a `dyn Display` or `dyn Error`, `Box<dyn Error>` from `?` and a message included, is a value and its dictionary ([ADR 0141](docs/decisions/0141-std-trait-objects.md)), and a `dyn` given to generic code is given Rust's built-in impl of its trait ([ADR 0049](docs/decisions/0049-traits-and-generics.md)); a placeholder's options reach a generic or `dyn` value's `fmt`, which can ask its `Formatter` for them ([ADR 0143](docs/decisions/0143-formatter-options.md)); a generic associated type of lifetimes is an associated type ([ADR 0146](docs/decisions/0146-generic-associated-types.md)); a generic function is given the size and name of a type parameter it asks for ([ADR 0145](docs/decisions/0145-type-facts.md)); [validation](src/lower/traits.rs) rejects generic const expressions, a generic associated type of a type with a bound, generic constants, and a generic impl's constant of its parameters. | Existing Rust abstractions and dependencies may not compile unchanged. |
| Mutable references | A `&mut` in a variable, a generic `&mut T`, one to a closure, and a `&mut dyn` of the crate's traits are supported ([ADR 0099](docs/decisions/0099-mut-references.md)); a generic iterator lent as a `&mut` is the lender's JS iterator ([ADR 0071](docs/decisions/0071-stepping-iterators.md)); `*r = v`, `mem::replace`, `swap` and `take` replace an object in place ([ADR 0147](docs/decisions/0147-replacing-through-mut.md)); a `&mut` std hands out to a number or a string, `iter_mut()`'s or `get_mut`'s, is a handle on it ([ADR 0152](docs/decisions/0152-std-item-handles.md)); a generic `&mut T` to an object inside what a generic function takes or gives, a `&mut dyn` of std's traits, and a trait's `&mut self` method of a generic iterator remain. | Reusable application helpers may exceed the current reference model. |
| Options, maps, and iterators | A `HashMap` or `HashSet` keyed by a struct, a tuple or an enum with fields, whose `Eq` is derived, finds its keys by value ([ADR 0121](docs/decisions/0121-value-keys.md)); an iterator trait object, boxed or lent, is a JS iterator ([ADR 0140](docs/decisions/0140-iterator-trait-objects.md)); an `Option` of what can look like `None` boxes its `Some` ([ADR 0051](docs/decisions/0051-generic-options.md)); `collect()` into a `Result` or an `Option` stops at the first `Err` or `None` ([ADR 0036](docs/decisions/0036-iterators-and-sorting.md)); [diagnostic cases](test/diagnostics.test.ts) include keys of a custom `PartialEq`, B-trees of struct keys, map equality, `collect()` into a `Result` of anything but an array, and held-iterator restrictions. | Combinations matter even when each broad feature is listed as supported. |
| JSX authoring | [JSX boundaries](docs/jsx.md#current-boundaries) include macro composition and missing stock editor expansion. | Daily development and reusable component patterns need a tested workflow. |
| Text and slices | A string's length, slices and offsets count its UTF-8 bytes ([ADR 0138](docs/decisions/0138-string-byte-counts.md)); a closure, a function or a set of `char`s is a pattern ([ADR 0157](docs/decisions/0157-char-predicates.md)); the [text contract](docs/decisions/0063-text.md) leaves mutable range slices and UTF-8 decoding unsupported; [diagnostics](test/diagnostics.test.ts) cover stored ranges. | Portable parsing and reusable algorithms depend on precise text and borrowing semantics. |
| Resource lifetime | Destructors run where Rust runs them ([ADR 0098](docs/decisions/0098-destructors.md)); an `Rc`, an `Arc` or a thread-local holding a value with one, a `dyn` of std's traits owning one, such as `Box<dyn Send>`, a closure holding part of one, and some temporaries, such as a let-chain's, are rejected. | Native RAII cleanup cannot be assumed to follow JavaScript garbage collection. |

## Public playground track

Track this separately from production readiness of generated applications.

- [ ] **P1 — Isolate executed programs.** The current
  [preview runner](wasm/web/rust/programs.rs) intentionally uses an unsandboxed
  frame. Define the trust model, isolate untrusted execution, and test parent
  access, message validation, runaway programs, and recovery before advertising
  it as safe for untrusted snippets.
- [ ] **P2 — Run React examples in the preview.** Today the playground displays
  generated JSX but its runner executes plain JS/DOM programs. Either add and
  test a JSX/React execution path or keep that boundary explicit in the UI.
- [ ] **P3 — Measure browser compiler reliability.** Establish download/startup
  and memory budgets, cancellation/recovery behavior, and cross-browser checks
  for the hosted compiler. Keep deployed compiler versions identifiable.

## Keeping this roadmap useful

Update the relevant checkbox in the same change that completes its acceptance
criteria. Add a commit/PR and test or measurement evidence beside completed
items. Use **in progress** only when linked work has started; use **blocked**
with a concrete dependency. Update the baseline when reassessing readiness.

New features belong under the gate they unblock. Record intentional exclusions
explicitly. Track completed gates and remaining blockers instead of assigning
an overall percentage to an undefined amount of work.
