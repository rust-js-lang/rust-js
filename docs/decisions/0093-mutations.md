# 0093. Known bugs put back into the compiler, which the tests must catch

Status: Accepted. Extends [0088](0088-corpus.md), [0089](0089-rustc-tests.md) and [0092](0092-generated-programs.md).

Case: N ([0262](0262-when-rust-and-js-disagree.md)).

## Context

A test that passes says the compiler does what the test checks, not that
the test would see it do otherwise. A corpus case can pass because it's
right, or because it no longer reaches the code it was written for. Twice,
generated programs were run against a compiler with a fix taken out, on a
branch made by hand, to see whether they'd find the bug again: once they
didn't, and the generator was taught what it lacked.

## Decision

**`scripts/mutations.ts` puts known bugs back, one at a time, and runs the
tests named for each against the compiler built with it.** The mutations
are in `scripts/mutations/`, one list for each source file, at its path
from `src/`: `src/lower/traits.rs`'s in `scripts/mutations/lower/traits.ts`,
so code that moves takes its mutations with it. (Amended: one list for
all, 3,400 lines by its 400th.) A mutation is a
change to one place in the compiler's source, found exactly as it's
written, and what it breaks, as Rust would see it:

| Mutation | Breaks | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| `element-value-first` | `v[i] = f()` checks `i` before `f` runs | `assignment_order*.rs` |
| `compound-place-read` | `x += g()` reads `x` before `g` changes it | `assignment_order.rs` |

| `pattern-parts-kept-owned` | a part a pattern moves out is dropped with what it's matched against too | `drop_partial.rs` |

- **The tests must pass as the compiler is, and run at all,** so their
  failing against a mutation is the mutation's doing, **and fail with a
  compiler that compiles nothing,** so they're using the one they're
  given. The runner's first version set `RUST_JS_COMPILER` in its own
  `process.env`, which Bun doesn't give a process it starts: every
  mutation survived, tested against the compiler as it is.
- **A mutation that isn't caught fails the run,** and so does one that no
  longer applies, as the code it changed has moved, or one that doesn't
  build: each must be made to apply again, or its tests made to see it.
- The crate is copied to `target/mutants/` and built there, with a target
  of its own, so the checkout's build isn't touched, and only rust-js is
  built again for each.
- It builds a few native programs for each, which macOS makes slow, so the
  rustc tests workflow runs it on Linux with `mutations` (AGENTS.md).
- **A mutation's tests skip the corpus's snapshots** (`RUST_JS_SNAPSHOTS=ignore`):
  nearly any change to the compiler changes some case's JS, so they'd
  catch every mutation, and say nothing of whether what the JS does is
  checked.

## Why

- **It's the claim a green run makes, tested:** that each of these bugs,
  back, turns it red.
- **Each is a bug rust-js had, or one a rule keeps out,** so it's what the
  tests were written for, not a change no program would notice.

## Alternatives

- **A mutation tool, such as `cargo-mutants`:** it changes every operator
  and return it finds, most of which the corpus was never meant to cover,
  and each is a build of rust-js; a list of known bugs is small, and says
  what each test is for.
- **Patches:** they stop applying without saying which line moved; a
  change found as it's written says so.

## Consequences

- A mutation names the code it changes as it's written, so a change to
  that code makes it fail to apply, and it's updated with the code.
- The set is a start: a fix worth keeping is worth a mutation, as its
  corpus case is.
- **A mutation is caught only by a test that failed:** the runner ends as
  it does when one does, and names at least one that didn't run out of
  time. One that ran out of time, or whose tests did, was stopped, or
  failed before any test did is inconclusive, which
  fails the run as a survivor does, without saying it's caught; each
  mutation's log is kept in `target/mutants/logs/`. Found in review: every
  failed process had counted as caught. Later, a test that timed out had,
  then one whose `beforeEach` hook did.

## Amendment: a change's mutations are of what it touches

A check of a change, `--changed=<base>`, ran every mutation of each file
it touched: one line of `lower/jsx.rs` reran its 130, nearly all of code
the change didn't come near, and a day's check took 45 minutes. It now
runs, besides those it adds or edits:

- **those in a function it changes**, the function the mutated code is
  in, found as rustfmt and Prettier lay one out (`fn` or `function`, and
  `}` at its indent); code in none, its lines and ten each side;
- **those whose test it changes**: a test their `-t` names, its comment
  above included, or all of a file's, where it changes what they share,
  above the first; and a corpus case their `-t` names;
- **one that no longer applies**, to say so.

A change elsewhere can still matter to one, as making the code it guards
redundant for its test (`captured-base-copied`, after a lowering change
in another file): the nightly run of every mutation finds that, a day
later at most. Of the checks of the last day's commits, it ran a third to
a half as many. `test/ci.test.ts` checks how it chooses.

## Amendment: a mutation's test builds only what it needs

A mutation is judged by its tests alone, but `compiler.test.ts` compiles
some forty programs and runs native Rust before any of its tests runs, for
the ones that check those programs. A mutation of a test of its own
program paid for all of that, and was inconclusive where it broke one of
them, as `regex-slash-unescaped` did the playground. The 59 of its tests
that read none of that are in files of their own, each building only the
crates: `bindings.test.ts`, the binding language and the js and webapi
crates; `modules.test.ts`, a crate's modules as files; `stable.test.ts`,
plain stable Rust; and `lowering.test.ts`, the rest. `compiler.test.ts`
keeps the 45 that check its programs.
